## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

- **Message Templates: Incorrect workflow IDs on new sites ([dev/core#1082](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1082): [#14663](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14663))**

    The sample data-set used in new sites (v5.14.0-v5.14.1) incorrectly linked
    system message-templates to workflow steps, leading to incorrect message
    delivery. This should not affect pre-existing sites or sites initialized
    with empty data. For sample sites initialized on v5.14.0-v5.14.1, please
    recreate them or discuss cleanup tasks in the Gitlab issue.

- **Contact Dashboard: Fix activity listing in some ACL scenarios  ([dev/core#1052](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1052): [#14596](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14596), [#14610](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14610))**
